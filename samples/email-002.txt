Subject: Slow Computer Performance

Dear Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to report a significant issue affecting my computer's performance. The computer has been running extremely slow for the past few days, causing delays and productivity loss in my daily work.

I have noticed that even simple tasks such as opening applications or browsing the internet are taking an unusually long time to complete. Additionally, there is a noticeable lag when switching between applications or performing basic operations like copying files. These performance issues are hindering my ability to work efficiently and are becoming increasingly frustrating.

To provide some context, my computer is a Dell Inspiron 15 with an Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It has been running smoothly for the past year, but the sudden decline in performance is concerning. I have not made any recent software installations or system changes that could have caused this slowdown.

I have already taken some troubleshooting steps on my own, including running a full system scan for viruses and malware using our company's antivirus software, as well as performing a disk cleanup and defragmentation. However, these measures have not improved the performance of my computer.

Given the impact on my productivity, I kindly request your assistance in resolving this issue as soon as possible. Please let me know if there are any further steps I can take or if you require any additional information from me to diagnose and rectify the problem.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

John Anderson
